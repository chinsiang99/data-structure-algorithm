/*
 * Pascal's Triangle:
 * A triangular array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
 * The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top (row 0).
 * Example:
 *                1
 *              1   1
 *            1   2   1
 *          1   3   3   1
 *        1   4   6   4   1
 *      1   5  10  10   5   1
 *
 * Properties:
 * 1. Each row starts and ends with 1.
 * 2. The n-th row corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion (a + b)^(n-1).
 * 3. Symmetry: Each row is symmetric about its center.
 * 4. The sum of all elements in the n-th row is 2^(n-1).
 * 5. The k-th element in the n-th row can be calculated using:
 *      C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

// there basically will have three types of interview questions can be made up
// 1) given row & column, give the value
// 2) given row, print out all the values (meaning one row, all column of it)
// 3) given row and column, print out the traiangle

// for this kind of questions, we need to utilize the nCr mathematics
