this repo is to help me to continue refreshing the dsa that had been learnt before

note tat 10^8 time complexity normally takes 1 second

note that ascii for A is 65, a is 97, z is 122
remember that in order to get 'a', we can use String.charCodeFrom(97)
remember that if we want to get the ascii value, we can use 'a'.charCodeAt(0)

ok, we have a tool here which can determine the largest integer and smallest integer in javascript

```javascript
console.log(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
console.log(Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER)
```
